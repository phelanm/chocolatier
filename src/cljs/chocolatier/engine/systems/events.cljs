;; Anyone can send a message to the event bus
;; The event system distributes the events to any subscribers into
;; their inbox component state
;; Events are tuples of event keyword, the sender, and message hm
;; Messages should only be used for asynchronous communication
;; Avoid sending messages based recieving a message to prevent
;; circular messages happening

;; This needs to be globally accessible to all systems and component
;; functions

;; How do we do this without a singleton?
;; Update the component function to get the component state and it's
;; mailbox. Mailboxes are per entity/component.
;; Add a function to add a subscription for a given
;; event/entity/component id
